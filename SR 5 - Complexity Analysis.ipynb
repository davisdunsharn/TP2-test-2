    "### Binary Search Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "- Binary search divides the search interval in half with each iteration.\n",
    "- At each step, it eliminates half of the remaining elements.\n",
    "- Therefore, the time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n",
    "- This means that the time taken by binary search grows logarithmically with the size of the input. It is significantly faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "- Binary search typically has a space complexity of O(1).\n",
    "- It does not require any additional space proportional to the size of the input.\n",
    "- Binary search operates on the input array in place, using only a few variables for indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency:**\n",
    "- The efficiency of binary search is evident in its time complexity of O(log n).\n",
    "- It is particularly efficient for searching in large sorted datasets.\n",
    "- Even though it requires the list to be sorted initially, the cost of sorting is outweighed by the efficiency of the search.\n",
    "- Binary search's time complexity makes it a preferred choice for searching in large datasets or real-time applications where performance is crucial.\n"
